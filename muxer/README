On Debian, requires youtube-dl, download from: https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/

requires package libav-tools: sudo apt-get install libav-tools

Four environment variables need to be set to use the muxer:

MESHUGGAHME_AVCONV_PATH - location of avconv (from libav-tools, probably /usr/bin/avconv, ffmpeg should drop-in)
MESHUGGAHME_YTDL_PATH - location of youtube-dl, it's wherever you put it (make sure you chmod +x'ed it)
MUSHUGGAHME_DL_PATH - Where to drop videos downloaded from youtube
MUSHUGGAHME_OUTPUT_PATH - where to drop output files

For the muxer service, you'll also need to set the output URL env variable:

MUSHUGGAHME_OUTPUT_URL

(This will depend on how you've setup nginx or apache)
