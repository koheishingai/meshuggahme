On Debian, requires youtube-dl, download from: https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/

requires package libav-tools: sudo apt-get install libav-tools

Four environment variables need to be set to use the muxer:

MESHUGGAHME_AVCONV_PATH - location of avconv (from libav-tools, probably /usr/bin/avconv, ffmpeg should drop-in)
MESHUGGAHME_YTDL_PATH - location of youtube-dl, it's wherever you put it (make sure you chmod +x'ed it)
MESHUGGAHME_DL_PATH - Where to drop videos downloaded from youtube
MESHUGGAHME_OUTPUT_PATH - where to drop output files

For the muxer service, you'll also need to set the output URL env variable:

MESHUGGAHME_OUTPUT_URL

(This will depend on how you've setup nginx or apache)

API:

GET /muxer/
  return json document with the app_name and a version string

GET /muxer/mux_demux?yt_url=<yt_url>
POST /muxer/mux_demux body: yt_url=<yt_url>
  yt_url: Youtube URL.  Can be long or short (youtu.be)
  Synchronous call to pull down a video from youtube and meshuggahfy the audio
  returns json document: {'video_url': <video_url>}
  The video url is the drop location of the processed video, and will be statically served by nginx

There are no other API calls at this time.  This is currently running on systest-6.
(I may add an async version)

So, a GET against http://systest-6/muxer/mux_demux?yt_url=<url>  will get you a video link.
